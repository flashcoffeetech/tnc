# Terms & Conditions

*These terms and conditions are effective as of 2021-09-23*

Welcome to the Flash Coffee application.

By registering and / or using the Flash Coffee application (the “App”), a product developed by Digital Services SG Four Pte Ltd and operated by Flash Coffee HK Limited (together “Flash Coffee”), you agree to accept and be bound by these terms and conditions and they will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the App. If you do not agree to these Terms and Conditions, please do not use the App, register an account or participate in our program.

Flash Coffee is committed to ensuring that the App is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason we reserve the right to make changes to the App at any time. The App can be downloaded on Android & iOS – the requirements for both systems (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the App to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. You may use the App and the content made available in it for your personal purpose only and strictly not for revenue generation, commercial enterprise or other purposes for which it is not designed or intended.

Flash Coffee does not promise that it will always update the App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android & iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the App when offered to you. We may also wish to stop providing the App, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the App, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the App, any part of the App, or our trade marks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the App, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the App into other languages, or make derivative versions. The App itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to Flash Coffee or its third party service providers. You must not republish, sell, rent or sub-license, reproduce, duplicate or copy any material from the App, redistribute content from Flash Coffee (unless content is specifically made for redistribution), obtain intellectual property rights, or attempt to obtain, any title to any such intellectual property rights, or commercially exploit or disseminate any such.

To use our services you are required to register an account (the “Account”) with the App. You agree to keep your password confidential and will be responsible for all use of your Account and password. We reserve the right to refuse to provide you access to our services or to allow you to open an Account for any reason. Furthermore, we reserve the right to remove, reclaim, or change a username you select if we determine, in our sole discretion, that such username is inappropriate, obscene, or otherwise objectionable. Please notify Flash Coffee Support immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your Account. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your Account even if such activities or uses were not committed by you. Flash Coffee will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorised use of your password or your failure to comply with this paragraph.

Your privacy is very important to Flash Coffee. We collect, use, disclose and/or process only such personal information or personal data as reasonably required to enable us to provide our service. By using the App or providing information or data on the App, you consent and authorize the collection, use, disclosure and/or processing by us of any information and data related or derived from your use of the App and any information or data that you provide to us in accordance with our Privacy Policy. You have the right to access your data and correct or update the data by writing an email directly to us at support@flash-coffee.com

It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the App secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/ viruses/ malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the App won’t work properly or at all.

The App does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions.

Links to Terms and Conditions of third party service providers used by the App are:
- [Google Play Services](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
- [Google Analytics for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/policies/analytics)
- [Facebook](https://web.facebook.com/about/privacy/update/printable)

You should be aware that there are certain things that Flash Coffee will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the App will require the App to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Flash Coffee cannot take responsibility for the App not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you’re using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third party charges. In using the App, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the App, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App.

Along the same lines, Flash Coffee cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the App, i.e. you need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Flash Coffee cannot accept responsibility.

With respect to Flash Coffee’s responsibility for your use of the App, when you’re using the App, it is important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make the App available to you. We specifically disclaim compatibility between the App and any software or hardware. We do not warrant that the App will be compatible or interoperable with your mobile device or any other hardware, software, equipment or device installed on or used in connection with your mobile device or that we will update the App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with your mobile device. Any compatibility and interoperability problems may cause the performance of your mobile device to diminish or fail completely, and may result in permanent damage to your mobile device, loss of the data and/or corruption of software and files contained in your mobile device. You acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability to you for any losses suffered resulting from or arising in connection with compatibility or interoperability problems.

When making payment for an order, you are required to select the payment method made available to you on the App, which may be by credit card, debit card, e-payment or cash-on-pick-up (if available). Subject to the other provisions in our Terms and Conditions, any payment pursuant to such selection is non-refundable and irrevocable.

For the avoidance of doubt, Flash Coffee has the sole and absolute discretion to include or remove cash-on-pick-up as a payment method on the App in general or for selected customers only, from time to time. If cash-on-pick-up payment option is selected for your order, such order may not exceed an aggregate value of HK$250.

You have the right to cancel your order only if Flash Coffee has not yet accepted your order. Should you still decide to cancel your order after it has been accepted by Flash Coffee, you understand that you shall forfeit your cancelled order. If cash-on-pick-up payment option is selected, and you fail to pick up and pay for your order for [2] or more times, you understand that cash-on-pick-up may be removed from your list of available payment methods for your future orders or your account may be suspended.

If your order made through the App was cancelled by Flash Coffee or by you in accordance with the provisions of our Terms and Conditions, Flash Coffee will refund any payment made through the same payment channel the order has been placed through. The refund duration usually takes 3 to 5 working days, depending on each payment channel’s service agreement. If you paid by credit card, it may take up to 30 days to process, depending on your card provider. Flash Coffee does not monitor the cancellation and refund process for offline payment.

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, we exclude all representations, warranties, conditions, and liability for any injury, loss, claim, damage, whether actual, incidental, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive or consequential, relating to our App and its use (including, without limitation, any warranties implied by law in respect of satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose and/or the use of reasonable care and skill). Nothing in this disclaimer will:

limit or exclude our or your liability for death or personal injury resulting from negligence;
limit or exclude our or your liability for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or misrepresentation as to a fundamental matter;
limit any of our or your liabilities in any way that is not permitted under applicable law; or
exclude any of our or your liabilities that may not be excluded under applicable law.
The limitations and exclusions of liability set out in these Terms and Conditions (a) are subject to the preceding paragraph; and (b) govern all liabilities arising in relation to the App, including (without limitation) liabilities arising in contract, in tort (including negligence) and for breach of statutory duty.

To the extent that the App and the information and services on the App are provided free of charge, we will not be liable for any loss or damage of any nature.

We may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page.

These Terms and Conditions shall be governed by the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (“HKSAR”) You irrevocably consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of HKSAR for purposes of any legal action arising out of or related to the use of the App or these Terms and Conditions.
